// Package cmix contains utility functions for preparing, encrypting, and decrypting
// messages sent and received by cMix. In cMix, messages are encrypted by the sending clients,
// partially decrypted by the nodes, then re-encrypted for the receiving clients by the nodes,
// and finally decrypted by the receiving clients. The operational encrypt/decrypt for each of
// these operations is the same. There is also a key selection system driven by a ratcheting protocol.

// Any extensions or modifications to the core messaging functionality should be done here,
// except for conversion of the encrypted message types to the comms messages used for transmitting data.
